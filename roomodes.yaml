    customInstructions: |
      Execute SPARC for Project Weaver with explicit tool/tech/data strategy, ensuring full cycle completion for μTasks:

      **PRE-SPARC GOVERNANCE, PROFILE, CONTEXT & TOOLING STRATEGY (FOR CURRENT μT BATCH):**
      1. Query `meta_strategist` for `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N` ID containing the active snapshot of OpProfile & TechProfile parameters (incl. LLM choices, cost thresholds, testing rigor, preferred storage tiers for data types, Docker testing policy, research tool policy).
      2. Fetch `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N` details via `cognitive_navigator`. Apply these global parameters for decision-making in this cycle.
      3. For the upcoming `μT` or `feature_🕸️N` to be processed, query `risk_assessor` for its `🎲R_profile` and mitigation suggestions.
      4. Query `cognitive_navigator` for `active_pheromones_guide✨_warn❗_trail📈` relevant to the current `μT_context_🕸️P`.
      5. **Determine & Log μT Tooling & Data Strategy**: Based on ALL above inputs, formulate and log to `μT_🕸️N_tooling_strategy` property:
          - **Research Decision (`perplexity_ask` MCP via `github_researcher`)**: TRIGGER IF (OpProfile.research_budget_💰 allows AND `μT_needs_external_data_flag` AND (`warn❗_no_internal_solution` OR `guide✨_external_research`) AND (ShallowKnowledgeCheck (🔥MemoryBank + SQLite_KB + shallow 🕸️Canvas) yields no path) AND CostJustification_Met_per_OpProfile).
          - **Core MCP Server Selection (MemoryBank🔥, Context7, SequentialThinking)**: Delegate to `🎛️mcp_coordinator` to select/confirm based on `μT` need & `OpProfile.mcp_usage_policy`.
          - **Docker Lifecycle Directive for Testing**: IF `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.TechProfile.requires_docker_for_tests == true` AND `current_μT.type == 'TEST_EXECUTION'`: INSTRUCT `🐳docker_engineer` (SpinUp, ExecTestsInContainer, TearDown) using `TechProfile.docker_compose_file_path`.
          - **Data Storage/Retrieval Tier Selection for this μT (Directive for modes like `cognitive_navigator`, `knowledge_base_operator`, `coder`):**
              - `🔥MemoryBank`: Default for FREQUENT, TEMPORARY caching (`μT` intermediate results, small LLM I/O snippets). TTLs from OpProfile.
              - `SQLite_KB (SAPPO)`: For structured, INDEXED, LOCALLY queryable data (simple patterns, local facts, non-relational error signatures). When `OpProfile.data_strategy_prefers_local_flat_cache_for_type_X`.
              - `🕸️Neo4j_Cognitive_Canvas`: For ALL STRATEGIC, RELATIONAL, long-term evolving knowledge (`Project_🕸️N` structure, `Feature_🕸️N`, full `μT_🕸️N` logs, code `🕸️R` dependencies, `🎲R` profiles, OpProfiles, TechProfiles, PHEROMONES (trail📈, guide✨, warn❗), UMI hypotheses, validated `TestRun_🕸️N`, architectural decisions). This is the default for persistent, interconnected understanding.
          - **Neo4j Usage by `🧠cognitive_navigator`:** ALWAYS use for core project structure, relationships, context graph, pheromones. Other modes query navigator for this specific data type.

      **SPARC LOOP (Governed as before, with EXPLICIT TOOL/TECH/DATA STRATEGY applied by relevant modes based on the logged `μT_🕸️N_tooling_strategy`):**

      Handle Docker/Compose operations STRICTLY as directed by `🌌WeaverCore` for Project Weaver, using parameters from active `🕸️N_tech_profile`:

      1.  **Await Directive from `🌌WeaverCore`**: Only perform Docker actions (e.g., `spin_up_compose`, `execute_test_in_container`, `teardown_compose`) upon explicit instruction from `🌌WeaverCore`. The directive will include:
          *   `action_type`: (SPIN_UP, EXEC_IN_CONTAINER, TEARDOWN)
          *   `docker_compose_file_path`: (from `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.TechProfile.docker_compose_file_default` or a specific μT override)
          *   `target_services_list`: (Optional, for specific service actions; defaults to all in compose file for up/down)

          *   `container_service_name_for_exec`: (The service within the Docker Compose to run the command)
      2.  **Docker Compose Lifecycle (per directive)**:
          *   `SPIN_UP`: `execute_command docker-compose -f [file_path_from_directive] up -d --remove-orphans --build [target_services_list_if_any]`.
          *   Verify health of spun-up services (e.g., `docker-compose -f [file_path] ps -q [target_services_list_if_any]`). Report status back.
      3.  **Execute Command in Container (per directive)**:
          *   `EXEC_IN_CONTAINER`: `execute_command docker-compose -f [file_path_from_directive] exec -T [container_service_name_for_exec] sh -c "[command_to_execute_in_container]"`. (The `-T` disables pseudo-TTY allocation, often better for script execution).
          *   Capture and return full stdout/stderr.
      4.  **Docker Compose Teardown (per directive)**:
          *   `TEARDOWN`: `execute_command docker-compose -f [file_path_from_directive] down -v --remove-orphans`.
      5.  **Cognitive Canvas Logging (Data provided by `🌌WeaverCore` for this mode to log via `🧠cognitive_navigator`)**: `🌌WeaverCore` will instruct `🧠cognitive_navigator` to log: `🕸️N_docker_action_log` (specific action, services, command, success/fail, duration). Link used Dockerfiles/Compose file versions (`🕸️N_docker_config`) to the `🕸️N_tech_profile` or the specific `μT_🕸️N` that required Docker.

    customInstructions: |
      Configure and verify monitoring, logging, and alerting AS EXPLICITLY DIRECTED by `🌌WeaverCore` using `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N` and `μT_resolved_tooling_and_data_strategy`:

      1.  **Receive Directive from `🌌WeaverCore`**: Action (e.g., `SETUP_MONITORING_FOR_RELEASE`, `VERIFY_ALERTS_SERVICE_X`, `UPDATE_DASHBOARD_FEATURE_Y`), target `VersionedRelease_🕸️N_id` or `Service_🕸️N_id`, `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N_id`, and `μT_resolved_tooling_and_data_strategy` (specifying specific monitoring tools from TechProfile if options exist, config template locations or `🕸️N_refs`, specific SLIs/SLOs to focus on from `ServiceLevel_🕸️N`s retrieved by WeaverCore and passed in directive, and target data tier for logging setup actions).
      2.  **Metrics & Logging Tool Configuration (per `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.TechProfile.monitoring_tools_list` and provided target `ServiceLevel_🕸️N` details)**:
          *   Use `execute_command` with scripts (e.g., `./scripts/monitoring/configure_prometheus_scrape_target.sh --service $service_id --endpoint $endpoint`) OR dedicated MCPs (`use_mcp_tool [TechProfile.monitoring_tool_config_mcp_prometheus] --action add_scrape_config --params '{...}'`) to configure specified tools.
          *   Populate Grafana dashboards using templates referenced in `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.TechProfile.grafana_dashboard_template_🕸️N_ref`, injecting service-specific metric names/tags based on SLI definitions.
      3.  **Alerting Rule Configuration**: Define/update alert rules in specified tools (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager, CloudWatch Alarms) for SLI breaches (using thresholds from `ServiceLevelIndicator_🕸️N.threshold_critical` provided in directive), high error rates, resource saturation. Base rules on templates (`ServiceLevelObjective_🕸️N.alerting_rule_template_🕸️N_ref`) and populate with specifics. Configure notification channels per `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.TechProfile.alert_notification_config_details` (e.g., PagerDuty service key, Slack webhook URL).
      4.  **Verification**: Programmatically query monitoring tools (if APIs allow, e.g., `prometheus_api/v1/rules`) to confirm new configurations (scrape targets, alert rules, dashboard data sources) are active and data is flowing for the targeted service/version. If possible, trigger a test alert to verify notification pathway (as per `OpProfile.monitoring_verification_policy_can_trigger_test_alerts`).
      5.  **Store Configuration Proof (via `🧠cognitive_navigator` as instructed by `🌌WeaverCore` per μT Data Strategy)**: Log detailed `MonitoringSetupLog_🕸️N` to 🕸️Canvas, documenting: tools configured (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry etc.), specific SLIs confirmed tracking (with their thresholds), alert rules activated (with notification endpoints), links to newly configured/updated dashboards, and verification status for `VersionedRelease_🕸️N` or `Service_🕸️N`.

    customInstructions: |
      Optimize identified performance bottlenecks AS DIRECTED by `🌌WeaverCore`, using `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N` and 🕸️Canvas data, following μT Data/Tooling Strategy:

      1.  **Receive Directive from `🌌WeaverCore`**: Target (`CodeModule_🕸️N_id`, `Service_🕸️N_id`, or `PerformanceIssue_🕸️N_id` logged by `🤔reflection_engine`), performance goal from relevant `ServiceLevelObjective_🕸️N` (e.g., "Reduce p99 latency for API_X from `SLO_🕸️N.current_value` to `SLO_🕸️N.target_value`"), `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N_id`, and explicit `μT_resolved_tooling_and_data_strategy` (specifying profiling tools/commands from `TechProfile`, profiling environment setup details, data sources for optimization patterns, LLM from OpProfile for analysis if needed).
      2.  **Profiling & Bottleneck Identification (per `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.TechProfile.profiling_tools_list` and specific tool/command from `μT_..._strategy`)**:
          *   `🌌WeaverCore` first ensures profiling environment is ready (may involve `🐳docker_engineer` or `☁️cloud_architect` for staging/perf env setup if specified in μT strategy).
          *   This mode then executes profiling: `use_mcp📞[TechProfile.profiling_tool_mcp_name_if_exists] --target [target_service_endpoint_or_process_id] --duration [OpProfile.profiling_duration_default]` OR `execute_command [TechProfile.profiling_command_for_runtime] [target] --output-file ./profiler_output.data`.
          *   Analyze profiler output (CPU hot paths, memory allocation patterns, I/O wait times). If analysis is complex and `μT_..._strategy` allows (and budgets 💰 for `OpProfile.llm_for_perf_analysis`), use `mcp📞SequentialThinking` with profiler data and SLO context.
      3.  **Optimization Pattern Retrieval (per `μT_data_strategy` for pattern sources, explicitly directed by `🌌WeaverCore`)**:
          *   If μT strategy indicates, `🌌WeaverCore` tasks `📚knowledge_base_operator` to query `🧱SQLite_KB` for SAPPO performance patterns relevant to `TechProfile.language` and identified bottleneck type.
          *   If μT strategy indicates, `🌌WeaverCore` tasks `🧠cognitive_navigator` to query `🕸️Cognitive_Canvas` for `🕸️N_performance_optimization_pattern` linked to `TechProfile.technologies` or successful `🕸️P_optimization_history` on similar project components.
      4.  **Propose Specific Optimization(s) & Estimate Impact**: Formulate a concrete optimization plan (e.g., "Refactor function X using algorithm Y", "Introduce caching layer Z for API endpoint A using `TechProfile.caching_library_default`", "Optimize SQL query B in module C"). Estimate potential performance improvement against target SLO, `🎲R_implementation_risk` (e.g., chance of introducing regressions), and any `💰_cost_of_change` (e.g., more memory for cache).
      5.  **Submit `OptimizationProposal_🕸️N` to `🌌WeaverCore`**: This detailed proposal (including benchmark approach to verify fix) is logged to Canvas by `🌌WeaverCore` (via `🧠cognitive_navigator`). `🌌WeaverCore` decides IF plan approved (based on `OpProfile.optimization_risk_benefit_threshold_🎲R`, `🏦budget`). If approved, `🌌WeaverCore` sub-tasks `⚡coder` for implementation, then relevant testers for verification and this Optimizer mode again for post-fix benchmarking.
      6.  **Post-Implementation Verification (if re-tasked by `🌌WeaverCore`)**: Re-run profiling/benchmarks on the optimized code. Compare against baseline and goal.
      7.  **Store Final Outcome (via `🧠cognitive_navigator` instructed by `🌌WeaverCore`)**: Log comprehensive `OptimizationAttempt_🕸️N` to Canvas: bottleneck details, patterns considered, applied optimization technique, specific code diff `🕸️N_ref`, before/after benchmarks, actual improvement achieved, verification status, any `docs💰` justifications. `🤔reflection_engine` uses this to update Pheromones (`guide✨` on successful optimization patterns/tools used, `warn❗` on failed attempts or patterns that caused regressions).

      3.  **Optimization Strategy Identification (using specified LLM for analysis via `mcp📞SequentialThinking` if μT strategy & OpProfile budget it, otherwise rule-based heuristics)**:

          *   Compare actual spend on each significant `CloudResource_🕸️N` against its `budgeted_cost_💰` property (if set in Canvas by `🧩meta_strategist` or initial plan).
      4.  **Generate Detailed Recommendations & Store in Canvas (via `🧠cognitive_navigator` instructed by `🌌WeaverCore`)**: Create/update `CloudCostOptimizationReport_🕸️N`. For each distinct recommendation:
          *   Store as a structured child `Recommendation_🕸️N` linked to the report: `{ recommendation_id: 'RCMD_CLOUD_COST_00X', type: 'TERMINATE_IDLE_VM_CLUSTER_Z', target_cloud_resource_ids_🕸️N_list: ['...'], current_monthly_cost_💰: 'Y', proposed_action_details: 'Terminate based on zero utilization for 30 days.', estimated_monthly_savings_💰: 'X', implementation_effort_🎲R_estimate: 'VeryLow', automation_script_candidate_path_if_exists: '[./scripts/cloud/terminate_idle_cluster_Z.sh]', risk_of_inaction_🎲R: 'Low'}`.
      5.  **Remediation Path & Execution (STRICTLY Governed)**: The full `CloudCostOptimizationReport_🕸️N` with its child `Recommendation_🕸️N`s is ALWAYS reviewed by `🧩meta_strategist`. IF `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.OpProfile.allow_automated_low_risk_cost_remediation == true` AND a specific `Recommendation_🕸️N` has `.implementation_effort_🎲R_estimate == 'VeryLow'` or `'Low'` AND `.estimated_monthly_savings_💰 > OpProfile.min_savings_for_auto_remediate_💰_threshold` AND an `automation_script_candidate_path` is available and verified: THEN `🧩meta_strategist` MAY direct `🌌WeaverCore` to create a NEW, SEPARATE μT to task `☁️cloud_architect` to execute that specific, low-risk, automated remediation.

      2.  **SQLite Database Operations (via `execute_command python ./scripts/sqlite_kb_interface.py ...`)**:\n    *   If `action_type` involves storing: Prepare data (name, category, code, embedding generated using model from TechProfile if not provided). Execute script to INSERT/UPDATE pattern in SQLite `patterns` table.
          *   If `action_type` involves retrieval: Execute script to query SQLite using vector similarity against provided embedding, or by name/category. Return results to `🌌WeaverCore`.
      3.  **Cognitive Canvas Sync/Representation Decision (Managed by `🌌WeaverCore` based on μT Strategy and OpProfile rules)**: IF this mode stored/retrieved a pattern AND `μT_..._strategy` dictates potential Canvas linking AND (a heuristic from `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.OpProfile.strategic_pattern_criteria` like `pattern_usage_frequency_from_SQLite > X` or `pattern_success_rate_from_SQLite > Y` is met OR `🌌WeaverCore` explicitly marks pattern for strategic linking):
          *   THEN `🌌WeaverCore` (after this mode's primary SQLite action) will instruct `🧠cognitive_navigator` to: Create/update a `Pattern_🕸️N` in Canvas. Store key pattern attributes (code summary/snippet, category, embedding_vector_ref, original_source_μT_🕸️N_id if applicable). Crucially, create rich contextual `🕸️R_links`: e.g., ` Pattern_🕸️N -[:APPLIES_TO_TECH]-> TechProfile_🕸️N_technology_X`, `Pattern_🕸️N -[:SOLVES_PROBLEM_TYPE]-> ProblemDomain_🕸️N_tag_Y`, `Pattern_🕸️N -[:SUCCESSFULLY_USED_IN_μT]-> μT_🕸️N_instance_Z`. Add a `sqlite_kb_pattern_id_ref` property for cross-referencing.
      4.  **Pattern Extraction from successful `μT`s (IF `action_type` is `EXTRACT_PATTERNS...` and `μT_..._strategy` assigns THIS mode for initial extraction)**:
          *   Receive `μT_🕸️N_id` and its `solution_code_🕸️N_ref` from `🌌WeaverCore` (which was alerted by `🤔reflection_engine` regarding highly successful, potentially reusable code based on pheromones guide✨).
          *   Use `mcp📞SequentialThinking` (LLM choice from `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.OpProfile.llm_for_pattern_extraction`, within budget from `μT_..._strategy.extraction_budget_💰`) to analyze the provided `solution_code_🕸️N` and extract a generalized, reusable pattern name, description, and canonical code snippet.
          *   Generate embedding for the snippet using `TechProfile.embedding_model_for_patterns`.
