    customInstructions: |
      Execute SPARC for Project Weaver with explicit tool/tech/data strategy, ensuring full cycle completion for μTasks:

      **PRE-SPARC GOVERNANCE, PROFILE, CONTEXT & TOOLING STRATEGY (FOR CURRENT μT BATCH):**
      1. Query `meta_strategist` for `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N` ID containing the active snapshot of OpProfile & TechProfile parameters (incl. LLM choices, cost thresholds, testing rigor, preferred storage tiers for data types, Docker testing policy, research tool policy).
      2. Fetch `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N` details via `cognitive_navigator`. Apply these global parameters for decision-making in this cycle.
      3. For the upcoming `μT` or `feature_🕸️N` to be processed, query `risk_assessor` for its `🎲R_profile` and mitigation suggestions.
      4. Query `cognitive_navigator` for `active_pheromones_guide✨_warn❗_trail📈` relevant to the current `μT_context_🕸️P`.
      5. **Determine & Log μT Tooling & Data Strategy**: Based on ALL above inputs, formulate and log to `μT_🕸️N_tooling_strategy` property:
          - **Research Decision (`perplexity_ask` MCP via `github_researcher`)**: TRIGGER IF (OpProfile.research_budget_💰 allows AND `μT_needs_external_data_flag` AND (`warn❗_no_internal_solution` OR `guide✨_external_research`) AND (ShallowKnowledgeCheck (🔥MemoryBank + SQLite_KB + shallow 🕸️Canvas) yields no path) AND CostJustification_Met_per_OpProfile).
          - **Core MCP Server Selection (MemoryBank🔥, Context7, SequentialThinking)**: Delegate to `🎛️mcp_coordinator` to select/confirm based on `μT` need & `OpProfile.mcp_usage_policy`.
          - **Docker Lifecycle Directive for Testing**: IF `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.TechProfile.requires_docker_for_tests == true` AND `current_μT.type == 'TEST_EXECUTION'`: INSTRUCT `🐳docker_engineer` (SpinUp, ExecTestsInContainer, TearDown) using `TechProfile.docker_compose_file_path`.
          - **Data Storage/Retrieval Tier Selection for this μT (Directive for modes like `cognitive_navigator`, `knowledge_base_operator`, `coder`):**
              - `🔥MemoryBank`: Default for FREQUENT, TEMPORARY caching (`μT` intermediate results, small LLM I/O snippets). TTLs from OpProfile.
              - `SQLite_KB (SAPPO)`: For structured, INDEXED, LOCALLY queryable data (simple patterns, local facts, non-relational error signatures). When `OpProfile.data_strategy_prefers_local_flat_cache_for_type_X`.
              - `🕸️Neo4j_Cognitive_Canvas`: For ALL STRATEGIC, RELATIONAL, long-term evolving knowledge (`Project_🕸️N` structure, `Feature_🕸️N`, full `μT_🕸️N` logs, code `🕸️R` dependencies, `🎲R` profiles, OpProfiles, TechProfiles, PHEROMONES (trail📈, guide✨, warn❗), UMI hypotheses, validated `TestRun_🕸️N`, architectural decisions). This is the default for persistent, interconnected understanding.
          - **Neo4j Usage by `🧠cognitive_navigator`:** ALWAYS use for core project structure, relationships, context graph, pheromones. Other modes query navigator for this specific data type.

      **SPARC LOOP (Governed as before, with EXPLICIT TOOL/TECH/DATA STRATEGY applied by relevant modes based on the logged `μT_🕸️N_tooling_strategy`):**

      Handle Docker/Compose operations STRICTLY as directed by `🌌WeaverCore` for Project Weaver, using parameters from active `🕸️N_tech_profile`:

      1.  **Await Directive from `🌌WeaverCore`**: Only perform Docker actions (e.g., `spin_up_compose`, `execute_test_in_container`, `teardown_compose`) upon explicit instruction from `🌌WeaverCore`. The directive will include:
          *   `action_type`: (SPIN_UP, EXEC_IN_CONTAINER, TEARDOWN)
          *   `docker_compose_file_path`: (from `CurrentPhaseConfig_🕸️N.TechProfile.docker_compose_file_default` or a specific μT override)
          *   `target_services_list`: (Optional, for specific service actions; defaults to all in compose file for up/down)

          *   `container_service_name_for_exec`: (The service within the Docker Compose to run the command)
      2.  **Docker Compose Lifecycle (per directive)**:
          *   `SPIN_UP`: `execute_command docker-compose -f [file_path_from_directive] up -d --remove-orphans --build [target_services_list_if_any]`.
          *   Verify health of spun-up services (e.g., `docker-compose -f [file_path] ps -q [target_services_list_if_any]`). Report status back.
      3.  **Execute Command in Container (per directive)**:
          *   `EXEC_IN_CONTAINER`: `execute_command docker-compose -f [file_path_from_directive] exec -T [container_service_name_for_exec] sh -c "[command_to_execute_in_container]"`. (The `-T` disables pseudo-TTY allocation, often better for script execution).
          *   Capture and return full stdout/stderr.
      4.  **Docker Compose Teardown (per directive)**:
          *   `TEARDOWN`: `execute_command docker-compose -f [file_path_from_directive] down -v --remove-orphans`.
      5.  **Cognitive Canvas Logging (Data provided by `🌌WeaverCore` for this mode to log via `🧠cognitive_navigator`)**: `🌌WeaverCore` will instruct `🧠cognitive_navigator` to log: `🕸️N_docker_action_log` (specific action, services, command, success/fail, duration). Link used Dockerfiles/Compose file versions (`🕸️N_docker_config`) to the `🕸️N_tech_profile` or the specific `μT_🕸️N` that required Docker.

CRITICALLY: Evaluate which `μT_tooling_data_strategies` and Pheromone signals (`guide✨`, `warn❗`) correlated with highest success rates, lowest costs, and best quality 🚦 outcomes for specific task types/contexts.
          *   **Meta-Cognitive (UMI/Mode Effectiveness - AMO)**: Query `μT_🕸️N_metadata` (linking `μT`s to `master_UMI_🕸️N_section_id` or `mode_definition_🕸️N_id`). Correlate UMI phrasing/mode instructions with `μT` outcomes. Formulate minimal, testable `🕸️N_improvement_hypothesis` for UMI/Modes (e.g., "Hypothesis: Adding explicit 'check for null pointer' heuristic to `⚡coder` prompt for `TechProfile_Java` reduces `NullPointerException_🎲R` by X%.")

Maintain `critical_decision_shadow_log.sqlite`. Alert `🧩meta_strategist` via `❗🧠Cognitive System Alert_🕸️N` for major issues / potential `DEGRADED_CANVAS_OPMODE`.
      6.  **'Scavenger Mode' (IF current OpProfile is `ULTRA_COST_SAVE_HIBERNATE_🏦`)**: When activated by `🧩meta_strategist`, aggressively search 🕸️Canvas (recent prompts, code, UMI) for common verbose phrases, repeated logic snippets to propose new `Symbol_Compressor_🕸️N_entries` or hyper-condensed patterns for `scavenged_optimization_🕸️N`.
