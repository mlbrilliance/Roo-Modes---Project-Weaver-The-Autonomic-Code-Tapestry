**Project Weaver** is a revolutionary, fully autonomous AI software development framework designed to achieve "total hands-off" coding. It leverages a sophisticated orchestration of specialized AI agents, a central **🕸️ Cognitive Canvas** (Neo4j-based knowledge graph), and emergent **🧬 Pheromone-Guided Swarm Intelligence** to manage complex software projects from inception to deployment with minimal human intervention.

The system emphasizes **cost-effectiveness 💰, robustness 🛡️, continuous self-improvement 🤔, and adherence to best coding/testing practices (TDD 🚦)**.

## ✨ Core Philosophy & Vision

Project Weaver aims to transcend traditional AI code generation by creating a system that:

*   🧠 **Learns & Adapts:** Continuously refines its strategies, mode operations, and even its own Universal Mode Instructions (UMI).
*   🌐 **Understands Deeply:** Utilizes a rich Cognitive Canvas to build profound contextual understanding of projects, codebases, and its own operational history.
*   🐜 **Coordinates Intelligently:** Employs "digital pheromone trails" on the Cognitive Canvas for emergent, decentralized task prioritization and agent guidance.
*   ⚖️ **Balances Dynamically:** Operates under adaptive Operational Profiles and Technology Stack Profiles to manage tradeoffs between speed, quality, and cost based on project needs and available budget.
*   🛠️ **Self-Governs:** Implements layered governance through specialized meta-modes that oversee strategy, risk, quality, and system reflection.

**Our Goal:** To weave a future where complex software is autonomously created, maintained, and evolved by an intelligent, self-sustaining AI tapestry.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   🤖 **Total Hands-Off Autonomy:** Designed for minimal human intervention throughout the development lifecycle.
*   🕸️ **Cognitive Canvas (Neo4j):** A central, living knowledge graph storing all project data, code structures, learnings, risks (🎲R), operational parameters, and pheromone trails (trail📈, guide✨, warn❗).
*   🧬 **Pheromone-Guided Swarm Intelligence:** Specialized AI agents communicate and coordinate indirectly via "digital pheromones" on the Cognitive Canvas, enabling emergent task prioritization and guidance.
*   🧩 **Adaptive Governance Layer:**
    *   `🧩meta-strategist`: Sets dynamic Operational & Technology Stack Profiles. Manages budget (🏦) and A/B tests system improvements.
    *   `🎲risk-assessor`: Proactively identifies and scores (🎲R) risks associated with tasks and code changes.
    *   `🚦quality-gatekeeper`: Enforces strict quality standards, including TDD adherence (verifying test definitions in the 🕸️Canvas).
    *   `🤔reflection-engine`: Acts as a "Pheromone Scribe," analyzes system performance, drives autonomous meta-optimization (AMO) of UMI/Modes, conducts tech horizon scanning (📡), and ensures 🕸️Canvas integrity (🛡️).
*   ⚙️ **SPARC Execution Core:** The `🌌WeaverCore (Orchestrator)` manages the fundamental Situational Awareness, Problem Identification, Action Planning, Result Analysis, and Continual Improvement loop, heavily guided by the governance layer and 🕸️Canvas intelligence.
*   💰 **Extreme Cost Optimization:**
    *   Hyper-contextualization via Technology Stack Profiles and Pheromones reduces LLM token usage.
    *   Strategic Operational Profiles (including `ULTRA_COST_SAVE_HIBERNATE_🏦`) manage resource consumption.
    *   Strict justification protocols for high-cost actions.
*   💡 **Advanced Protocols:**
    *   Ambiguity Resolution Protocol (🚩) using low-cost exploratory sketches.
    *   Generative Innovation Protocol (💡) for tackling intractable problems (high-cost, budget-dependent).
    *   Autonomous Meta-Optimization (AMO) for self-improving Roo Modes and UMI.
*   🛡️ **Robustness & Resilience:** Proactive risk assessment, quality gates, cognitive integrity monitoring, and adaptive recovery mechanisms.
